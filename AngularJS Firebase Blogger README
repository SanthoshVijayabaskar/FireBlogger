FIREBASE

Firebase makes it possible to sync data in real time with our application without bothering about the back-end. All we need to do is make some API calls.

Firebase is a powerful API to store and sync data in real time. Combining the power of AngularJS two-way data binding with Firebase results in a three-way synchronization which is quite awesome.
